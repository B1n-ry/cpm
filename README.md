# CPM (Custom Projectile Models)

CPM is a minecraft mod built with the fabric mod loader, and will try to integrate projectile entity models in resource packs. 

~~Mod is currently in development and does not include these features yet~~

UPDATE: A mod got created which does what I wanted this to do. This project is discontinued. If someone somehow find their way over here looking for this, you can find this other mods github repositry [here](https://github.com/FoundationGames/JsonEM)
